Take two numbers:
1. One to count
2. One to determine what multiple to use to get there


Here is some sample input:
Count to: 30
Count by: 5
Output: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30

Count to: 50
Count by: 7
Output: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49

Don't forget to consider how to handle any input that might be submitted:

Empty values (user just presses enter)
Non-numeric values (It may be helpful to read up about the numerical value, NaN)
Negative numbers
Count by number is larger than the count to numbers

// Pseudocode alert!

for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index ++) {
  // Code that should run each time through the loop!
}

take number 1 and make that the END of the loop (where the loop should stop)
take number 2 and make that the INCREMENT in which the loop will increase by
